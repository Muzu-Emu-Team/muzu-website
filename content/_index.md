## Note:
Right-click copy the magnet links if your torrenting application isn't setup as the default program for magnet links. (If nothing happens when you click them.)

These link are not vetted, with all the chaos of Yuzu going down it has been of upmost importance to get people funneled into the new projects. However, *with all the chaos* it is possible someone has release a bad version of Yuzu or Citra into the wild, this is the risk you assume. Here be dragons.
